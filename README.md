## Features
- **Notification scheduler**: Customize your learning experience with a flexible notification scheduling. Choose 2 languages, to translate the received words from one to another. You can choose between English, French, German, Spanish and Romanian and after that you will be notified at the set time with a pair of translated words (either common or advanced ones). Also you can say a word, and you will be notified with related words (but this is only for English).
- **Detailed dictionary**: There is a built in dictionary, so you can acces it by typing a word and you will get details, like definition, synonyms, antonyms, related words and examples. Also you can save that word for later if you want too. (this feature is available only for English)
